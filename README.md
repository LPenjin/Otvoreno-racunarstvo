## Description

This data set contains fictional KSET members and the groups they are part of. Contains names, ID, start date of memberships and the end date. 
Every row also describes if a member has an orange membership. Without orange membership a member cannot be in two groups at once. Also, every member must be a college student and must have certificate of study. Exception to that rule have so-called "red" members who have done so much for the Club that KSET actually owes them for all the time they have invested. End date of their membership is always tommorow. People who have just graduated cannot get the certificate of study, but they can extend their membership for another year if they are nominated for a red member. 
Club also has 3 executive members. They manage higher level functions.
